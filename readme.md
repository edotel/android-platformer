Simple Platformer by BeefyDroid (Working name..)

I am making this game for the purpose of learning Android, and making my own engine with OpenGL ES.
This will not be sold on the Google Play store, but a version of it may be put up there for free.

LEGAL STUFF:
I haven't looked up the proper way to declare legal things, but it probably doesn't matter, this is
free to view anyway..

This game is currently in development. I wouldn't bother importing it into your IDE unless you want
to finish it..
